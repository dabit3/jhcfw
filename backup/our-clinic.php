                Patients are seen by appointment only. We strive to see all patients in a timely manner,
                but because of the nature of our practice, delays may occur.
                If possible, please arrive 15 minutes before your appointment time.
                If you are unable to keep your appointment, we request that you notify us as soon as possible,
