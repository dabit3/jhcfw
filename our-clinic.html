            </ul>
            <p class="this-line-height">Clinic hours are from 8:30 am to 5 pm Monday through Thursday and 8:30 am to noon on Friday.
                Patients are seen by appointment only. We strive to see all patients in a timely manner,
                but because of the nature of our practice, delays may occur.
                If possible, please arrive 15 minutes before your appointment time.
                If you are unable to keep your appointment, we request that you notify us as soon as possible,
                preferably at least 24 hours ahead.</p>

            <p><b>For after-hour emergencies, you may reach the on-call physician by calling the office number <a

            <p class="with-border-bottom this-line-height">Your call will be taken by our 24-hour answering service and relayed to the physician. Non-emergency
                calls should be made during normal office hours. During office hours, non-emergency calls will be
                returned as soon as
                possible but may be returned at noon or after clinic hours, depending on how busy the clinic is. For
                emergency
                calls during normal office hours, please notify the telephone receptionist, who will expedite your call.
                Prescription
                refills will only be made during normal office hours. Please have the phone number of your pharmacy
                available when
                you call or request a prescription online.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-extra-padding ">Fees</h3>
            <p class="this-line-height">
                Our fees are within the customary range for this area and reflect the level of care you receive and the
                high level of training of the physicians in the group. We have standardized charges for various
                procedures. These fees are available to you at any time. If you have any question about fees, please
                feel free to discuss them with our Financial Services Representative. Charges for our office visits are
                to be paid at the time of the visit, unless you are insured by one of the networks in which we
                participate. You are expected to pay any applicable co-pay and /or deductibles at the time of your
                visit. We will file most insurance plans for you. If you need to make payment arrangements, you may
                discuss these options with the Financial Services Representative prior to your scheduled
                appointment.</p>
